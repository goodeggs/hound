# Hound

This is a fork of the [Hound CI](http://houndci.com) service that automates PR-review process by commenting on style violations.

## Styleguides

Linters' configs are stored under the `config/style_guides` folder of the rails app.
Feel free to copy them to your dev machine to use locally in your favourite text editor. 

### CoffeeScript

Hound uses [coffeelint](http://www.coffeelint.org/) with the [custom config](https://github.com/goodeggs/hound/blob/master/config/style_guides/coffeescript.json) for CoffeeScript Linting. 

Lint config is shared by all the apps that use Hound, but it does not have to be so. If for some reason your app
needs to have it's own custom lint config which is different by the default one, follow [the instructions](https://houndci.com/configuration#configuration) from Hound CI to
include config into your apps' repo. 

### Javascript - TBD
