# Hound

This is a fork of the [Hound CI](http://houndci.com) service that automates PR-review process by commenting on style violations.

## Styleguides

Linters' configs are stored under the `config/style_guides` folder of the rails app.

- [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/goodeggs/hound/blob/master/config/style_guides/coffeescript.json)
- JavaScript - TBD!

Feel free to copy them to your dev machine to use locally in your favourite text editor.
